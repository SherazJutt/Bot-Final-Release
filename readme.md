# Important Notes

- **File and Variable Names**: The file names and variable names in this project are not case-sensitive. This means that `myVariable`, `MyVariable`, and `MYVARIABLE` will be treated as the same identifier.

- **Functions**: Function names are also not case-sensitive, so you can call a function regardless of how you capitalize its name. For example, `myFunction()`, `MyFunction()`, and `MYFUNCTION()` will all refer to the same function.
